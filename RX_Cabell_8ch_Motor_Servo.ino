// Test RC receiver with "Cabell" protocol (motor-servo driver, telemetry) using OpenAVRc and OpenTX Multiprotocol
//*********************************************************************************************************************
// Simple RC receiver from my repository https://github.com/stanekTM/RX_Cabell_8ch_Motor_Servo
//
// The hardware includes nRF24L01+ transceiver and ATmega328P processor.
// The firmware will be used for cars, boats, tanks, robots and aircraft. The code is Arduino.
//
// Works with RC transmitters:
// OpenAVRc                   https://github.com/Ingwie/OpenAVRc_Dev
// Multiprotocol from my fork https://github.com/stanekTM/TX_FW_Multi_Stane
